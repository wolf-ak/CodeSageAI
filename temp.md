The function you've written has a problem because `a` and `b` are not defined within its scope. When you define a
function like `function sum()`, it doesn't automatically know what `a` and `b` refer to unless they are passed as
arguments or declared globally (which is generally bad practice).

Here's how to fix it and make it work correctly, along with some common ways to write this function in JavaScript:

---

### The Problem

In your original code:

```javascript
function sum(){
return a+b; // 'a' and 'b' are not defined here!
}
```

When this function runs, JavaScript will look for variables named `a` and `b`. Since they aren't passed into the
function and aren't declared in an outer scope, you would get a `ReferenceError`.

### The Correct Way (Passing Parameters)

The most common and correct way to write a `sum` function for two numbers is to pass those numbers as **parameters** to
the function.

**1. Basic Function Declaration:**

```javascript
function sum(a, b) { // 'a' and 'b' are now parameters
return a + b;
}

// How to use it:
let result1 = sum(5, 3);
console.log(result1); // Output: 8

let result2 = sum(10, 20);
console.log(result2); // Output: 30
```

**2. Arrow Function (More Modern and Concise):**

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

// How to use it:
let result1 = sum(5, 3);
console.log(result1); // Output: 8

let result2 = sum(10, 20);
console.log(result2); // Output: 30
```

### Advanced / More Flexible `sum` Functions

Sometimes you might want a `sum` function that can add *any number* of arguments.

**1. Using the Rest Parameter (`...`):**

This allows the function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

```javascript
function sumAll(...numbers) { // 'numbers' will be an array like [1, 2, 3]
let total = 0;
for (let number of numbers) {
total += number;
}
return total;
}

// Or even more concisely with `reduce`:
// function sumAll(...numbers) {
// return numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);
// }

// How to use it:
console.log(sumAll(1, 2)); // Output: 3
console.log(sumAll(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // Output: 15
console.log(sumAll(10)); // Output: 10
console.log(sumAll()); // Output: 0 (or 0 with reduce)
```

Choose the version that best fits what you intend to do! For a simple sum of two numbers, the first two options are the
most appropriate.
